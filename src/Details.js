  Bhisma: {
    Name: "Bhishma Pitamaha",

    Introduction: `In the epic Mahabharata, Devavrata also known as Gangaputra and Bhishma (Sanskrit: भीष्‍म) was well known for his celibate pledge, the eighth son of Kuru King Shantanu, who was blessed with wish-long life and had sworn to serve the ruling Kuru king and grand-uncle of both the Pandavas and the Kauravas. He was an unparalleled archer and warrior of his time. He also handed down the Vishnu Sahasranama to Yudhishthira when he was on his death bed (of arrows) in the battlefield of Kurukshetra. He also belonged to the Sankriti Gotra.`,
    FairRole: `In the great battle at Kurukshetra, Bhishma was the supreme commander of the Kaurava forces for ten days. He fought reluctantly on the side of the Kauravas. Bhishma was one of the most powerful warriors of his time and in history. He acquired his prowess and invincibility from being the son of the sacred Ganga and by being a student of Lord Parashurama. Despite being about five generations old, Bhishma was too powerful to be defeated by any warrior alive at that time. Every day, he slew at least 10,000 soldiers and about a 1,000 rathas. At the beginning of the war, Bhishma vowed not to kill any of the Pandavas, as he loved them, being their grand-uncle. Duryodhana often confronted Bhishma alleging that he was not actually fighting for the Kaurava camp as he wouldn't kill any of the Pandavas. He also did not allow any of the Kauravas to be killed in the war, as he loved all his grand-nephews and wanted a peace negotiation.


Bhishma telling the secret of his death to the Pandavas
Duryodhana approached Bhishma one night and accused him of not fighting the battle to his full strength because of his affection for the Pandavas. On the next day there was an intense battle between Bhishma and Arjuna. Although Arjuna was very very skilled and Powerful, he was not fighting seriously as his heart was not in it to hurt his beloved grandsire Bhishma. Bhishma fired arrows such that Arjuna and Krishna were both injured. That angered Krishna who had already vowed to not raise a weapon in the war, lifted a chariot wheel and threatened Bhishma. Arjuna stopped Lord Krishna by convincing him to return to the chariot and put down the wheel, promising to fight with all his might and stop Bhishma. Thus Bhishma fulfilled his vow of forcing Krishna to raise a weapon. Then Arjuna used stronger weapons, injuring Bhishma. Bhishma and Arjuna's duel was praised by the gods themselves as they watched over it from the sky.`,
    UnfairRole: `When Bhishma was on arrow bead before dying Lord Krishna takes entire Pandavas to take lessons from him. That's is the time he gives Vishnu Saharsanama and he advises Yudhishttra on Raja neethi.Draupadi who was listening to this laughs at the end. Then entire Pandavas were embarrassed they look at draupadi and stood speechless.

Bhishma asks draupadi why did she laughed. Then draupadi replies such a noble upanyasam from a person like Bhishma was surprising and humorous and asks him where all these gyan he had went off when she was disrobed in open court. Where did all these Dharmic thoughts went off when Abhimanyuwas killed by treachery. How come he is remembering all this righteousness at the time of death.

Bhishma replied daughter draupadi all these days I have had food offered by Duryodhna and its negative effects was in his blood hence his body and intellect was corrupted, after Arjuna piereced him with all his arrows all that blood was gone. Since then he regained his senses back.

That is the reason God Sri Krishna says in Bhagavat geeta to Arjuna that food you eat shapes your destiny. Food , Body and soul are inter linked and hence God says that always offer food to me before you eat so that I take it as your offerings and take away all the negatives from it and convert that food as parshadh and give it back to you.

  Krishna: {
    Name: "Shree Krishna",
    Introduction: ``,
    FairRole: `One of the most profound verses of Gita comes in the 18th chapter. That one shlok, quite easily overlooked , conveys the entire gist of the Karma theory and Dharma.

Gita has ~700 shlokas. After delivering a counselling session of about 684 shlokas, that was to guide humanity over coming 1000s of years, Krishna tells Arjun in the 685th shloka

इति ते ज्ञानमाख्यातं गुह्याद्गुह्यतरं मया
विमृश्यैतदशेषेण यथेच्छसि तथा कुरु।।18.63।।

“I have told you that you should need to know, now think about it, and do as you wish”

The character of Krishna is one of the most significant characters in the above mentioned epic. Lord Krishna shows us how a ‘responsible man’ should behave in the time of domestic and international crisis. Even though he is the incarnation of Lord Vishnu, he displays all core human traits.

The character of Krishna begins to influence the plot when he sees how talented the Pandavas as a group during the Draupadi’s Swayamva. At this time the Pandavas were at exile and Krishna ties them together with a single knot which is by making an arrangement of sharing a single wife for all the five brothers. Even today it sounds like a bizarre idea. This shows that how articulate is his character and how he gets his visions achieved even if it calls for odd practices which might arose uncomfortable noises in the society.

We must also consider the fact that the Lord Krishna was at his fifties when he meet the Pandavas. Sri Krishna, the ‘Chief’ and the founder of Dwaraka. One of the major economic and cultural hub at the time. Before that, was already managed to relocate his cult ‘Yadavas’ to a safer place called ‘Dwaraka’ from the wrath of the Empire Jarasandha. That relocation involved evading a massive army and leading a large group of people including women, children and large folk of cattle through mountains which accommodates predator beasts. Later Dwaraka flourished to an influencing capital with his leadership. These incidents are not mentioned in the Mahabharata. I am just adding it to show that he was already a veteran in this kinds of affairs when the rift between the Kauravas and Pandavas gained his attention.`,
    UnfairRole: `The Supreme Personality of Godhead said to the brāhmaṇa: I am completely under the control of My devotees. Indeed, I am not at all independent. Because My devotees are completely devoid of material desires, I sit only within the cores of their hearts. What to speak of My devotee, even those who are devotees of My devotee are very dear to Me.

As chaste women bring their gentle husbands under control by service, the pure devotees, who are equal to everyone and completely attached to Me in the core of the heart, bring Me under their full control.

The pure devotee is always within the core of My heart, and I am always in the heart of the pure devotee. My devotees do not know anything else but Me, and I do not know anyone else but them
Krishna was considered as god. But he decieved Karna. And Duryodhan was considered as adharmi being. Duryodhan was a true friend of Karna. He gave his empire Ang to Karna when he didn't know the truth of Karna that he is the son of Sun God. He never insulted him. Pandavas were adharmi totally. Krishna never told them to not to do bet of his wife in dice game. So how could he classify pandavas as dharmi and karavas as adharmi? Bhishm pitamah and Dronacharya was good and dharmi beings. Dronachary was the great devotee of Lord Shiva and Bhishm was the son and devotee of Maa Ganga. Because they were not the devotee of Krishna so they were considered as evil and adharmi ….even Dronacharya killed by pandavas by deception. Ashvatthama too was devotee of Lord Shiva and even he would fight against Demon Kali in kalyug with Kalki Avtar. They were considered as evil and adharmi because they were not the devotees of Krishna. Krishna was considered as supreme above Lord Shiva and Lord Brahma. How is it possible?`,

  Karna: {
    Name: "Karna",
    Introduction: `Karna, also known as the sixth Pandava, is the unsung hero of the Mahabharata. Although he was the son of the solar God Surya, he was always discriminated against by most of the other characters for belonging to a lower caste. Also, despite being a loyal companion, his truthfulness was often misused by those whom he trusted. The tragedy of Karna’s life began before his birth when the sage Durvasa became a guest of Kunti’s father and Kunti served and treated him well for almost a year. Durvasa became impressed by the hospitality of Kunti and he granted her a boon. According to that boon, Kunti would be able to call any God and receive a child from him.

Kunti, though unmarried at that time, used that boon out of curiosity and called God Surya. And from him, she received the child, Karna. Although he was the son of a God, Kunti became frightened to bear the stigma of becoming a mother before marriage and she set little Karna afloat on a river, inside a basket, hoping that he would be found and taken care of by some other family. Later, A charioteer called Adhiratha and his wife Radha found Karna and raised him as their child. Karna was more interested in the art of warfare than in his adoptive father’s profession. But unfortunately, when he went to Dronacharya, the teacher of the princes, the latter refused him to accept him as his disciple, as Karna had no royal blood in his body.`,
    FairRole: `The Mahabharata is one of the greatest epics of all times. It narrates the battle between the Kauravas on the one side and the Pandavas on the other. The Pandavas, who represented righteousness, were outnumbered by the Kauravas during the time of the war. Nonetheless, the Pandavas, headed by Yudishthir,  emerged stronger than the opponents because they had Shri Krishna, the God by their side. The Pandavas, though fewer in number, won the battle of Kurukshetra, that witnessed human values degenerating. It was a war that not only saw warriors breaking the rules and disobeying the Kshatriya Dharma but redefined treachery, falsehood, deceit and greed.

Interestingly, one can learn invaluable lessons from each of the characters of the great Indian epic. In this web-post, we shall learn more about Karna, popularly known as Karan, one of the greatest warriors of all times.

Karna was the eldest son of Kunti. He was abandoned by her because he was born to her from the Sun God out of wed-lock. He was raised by a charioteer named Adhiratha and his wife, Radha. He lived in an era where only the Kshatriyas could learn the art of warfare and take lessons in artillery. He was so determined to become a warrior that he picked warfare skills on his own from the Sun God. He was as good as Arjuna, Dhronacharya's favourite disciple, in using the bow and the arrow. Thus, Karna teaches us to remain resolute if we wish to achieve our goal. `,
    UnfairRole: `Karna is the main reason Abhimanyu died in Padmavyuha. After Abhimanyu entered the Padmavyuha, he destroyed almost everything that stood in his way. He moved through the ranks of Kaurava soldiers as if they were dead leaves on a walkway. And, Abhimanyu a mere 19 year old boy, was all alone there. Looking at this, the proud ruler of Hasthina, Duryodhan started panicking. As he saw Abhmimanyu advancing in the battle field with such ferocity, a strong chill of fear ran through his spine.

Duryodhan immediately ran to Karna for help. Karna tried to stop Abhimanyu but he couldn’t succeed. The only way to stop Abhimanyu was to separate his mystical bow from his hand. As Karna couldn’t face him directly, he goes behind Abhimanyu’s back to break the bow. So, the great Karna went behind a mere 19 year old boy’s back to defeat him.

Even after losing his bow, Abhimanyu fought with other weapons, as the Kauravas and Karna disarmed and stabbed him in the back. In his final moments, Abhimayu asked Karna to lend him a small knife to fight. But the great “Daana Karna” refused.

Great virtues of Karna were kept aside for a few hours, just to kill a young boy. Karna may be great warrior, but he too had faults in his life.`,

  Duryodhana: {
    Name: "Bhishma Pitamaha",
    Introduction: `
Dhṛtarāṣṭra born blind married Gāndhārī. Hungry and thirsty, Vyāsa once came to Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s palace where Gāndhārī treated him sumptuously, and he blessed her to have hundred sons by her husband. Ere long Gāndhārī conceived, but even after two years she did not deliver. Grief-stricken at this she got herself aborted in secret as the result of which she 'delivered' a mass of flesh, and hearing about it Vyāsa visited her. As instructed by him hundred pots were filled with ghee, and the mass of flesh was sprayed with cold water as a result of which it got divided into hundred pieces, each the size of a thumb. Also a smaller piece of flesh remained. Those pieces of flesh were deposited in the pots filled with ghee and the pots kept in a secret place. Vyāsa departed for the Himālayas for tapas.`,
    FairRole: `Duryodhan lost because every friend who was on his side was with him for his own self interest and Pandavas won because Krishna was on their side for their interest and not his own

Karna wanted glory and was willing to sabotage Duryodhan's victory for it, he promised he will not kill 4 of the 5 pandavas before even the war started

Ashwatthama wanted to clear his father's debt to Hastinapur. Who gave his father a job when they were poor and then a kingdom for them to rule (half a kingdom)

Vinda and Anuvinda wanted revenge from Arjun's and Krishna for abducting their sister and killing Jarasandha

Jayadrath supported him because he wanted his humiliation at the hands of Pandavas avenged same for Susharna of Trigarth or Bhagadutta, or Bhurishravas who had an axe to grind with satyaki. Kritaverma was sent by Krishna to fulfill his promise or he needed a opportunity to get out of Krishna alliance

Not a single one of them came to Duryodhan to help him or for the sake of friendship

And we see the result.

So Duryodhan teaches me to choose my friends wisely who would support me in my time of need selflessly.
His real name was Suyodhan but because of his evil acts he was called Duryodhana by everyone forever.

Now let us see some of Duruyodana’s good qualities

1-Duryodhan remains a loyal friend to karna and Ashwatthama and his other allies.

2- When Guru Kripa humiliated Karna in an martial exhibition where the Kaurava and Pandava princes demonstrate their skills before their elders Duryodhana immediately defended Karna, and makes him king of Anga so that Karna can challenge Arjuna.
Here he is quick recognize Karna's strength as more than equal to Arjuna.

(People say he had his motives to have one person on his side matching Arjuna, but in just one meeting, that wasn’t possible to assess. But he kept faith. Also he listened and respected Karna all his life, that means when he became friends with Karna, he remained always. Though in the new Mahabharata, it is shown he insulted Karna, after knowing he was a Kaunteya, though that’s just showbiz. Actually it was Duryodhana, who cremated Karna in the end. Because it was his friend who died, not Eldest Pandava)

3- Knowing Sahadev’s ability as an astrologer even though Sahadev was going to fight against him in Kurukshetra war, Duryodhan asked him to fix
Muhurta time for commencement of war so that he can win.

4- He is revered by his younger brothers, for he is very affectionate towards them

5- He was a good disciple to Guru Drona, Kripa and Balarama and learnt martial skills; he was extremely powerful with the mace, and the equal of Bhima, the powerful Pandava, in its use.
`,
    UnfairRole: `Being the first-born son of the blind king, he was the crown prince of the Kuru Kingdom and its capital of Hastinapura, often forced into ceding the title to his cousin Yudhishthira, who was one of the Pandava brothers and older than him. Aided by his maternal uncle Shakuni, Duryodhana tricks the Pandavas into surrendering their kingdom and forces them to go into an exile. Later, Duryodhana waged the Kurukshetra War against his cousins and was helped by the warriors Bhishma, Drona and Karna. On the eighteenth day of the war, he was killed by Bheema. Duryodhana used his greater skill in wielding the mace to defeat his opponents. He was also an extremely courageous warrior and was said to be a good ruler, but his greed and arrogance were the two qualities said to have led to his downfall.`,

  Draupadi: {
    Name: "Draupadi",
    Introduction: `In the epic Mahabharata, Draupadi is the daughter of King Drupada, originally known as Princess Krishnaa (due to her dark complexion) and becomes the wife of the five Pandavas. When Yudhisthira becomes the king of Hastinapura, Indraprastha and the Emperor of India at the end of the war, Draupadi again becomes Queen.
Drupada had been defeated by Arjuna on behalf of Drona, who subsequently took half his kingdom to humiliate him. To gain revenge on Drona, he performed a great sacrifice to beget a powerful son who could kill him. Having been struck by Arjuna's valour, Drupada also prayed at the sacrifice for an exceptionally beautiful daughter to give to his, as a token of his appreciation. Draupadi thus emerged with Drishtadyumna from the sacrificial fire.`,
    FairRole: `
    Draupadi, the famous wife of all five Pandava brothers, is such an important personality in the Mahabharata. We can learn so much from her. She is a strong female character who continues to inspire people all over the world. Through the suffering she endured, she exemplified the qualities of a true queen. Three lessons we learn from her are her loyalty to her husbands and the Lord, speaking her mind and truth, and her sense of justice. 

Draupadi is one of the most loyal characters in the whole epic. She knew that she could’ve easily stayed out of most of the suffering that the Pandavas endured, but out of love, she chose to stay with her husband through thick and thin. She trusted them with her life and happiness. The same principle goes for how she trusted Lord Krishna. In the famous incident when Dushasana is attempting to disrobe her, Draupadi prays to Lord Krishna. She had faith and devotion throughout her life. 

Another important lesson to learn from Draupadi is how throughout the epic she is constantly voicing her opinion. Especially through suffering and pain, one can feel very overwhelmed and helpless. But Draupadi voices her opinions and makes her position clear. This is especially important and contributes to her role as a strong female personality. 
    When you are really awesome, you have to be extra cautious against hubris. Even a moment of arrogance can cost your honor. In the same way, your good deeds also will come to help you at the right time. Show some respect, miss.`,
    UnfairRole: `Draupadi didn’t believe her five husbands. During Draupadi Chirharan, she screamed a lot informant of her husbands, she begged for help in front of many people, but no one helps her. After this incident, she lost her husband’s trust because none of her husbands rescued her. No one showed the boldness against this entire act. Well, her reasons are genuine because Pandavas also delayed killing Kichaka. Kichaka was a man who misbehaved Draupadi. They denied to kill him for fear of making their secret identities public. They also denied killing Jayadhrata, the husband of her sister-in-law. 
    Draupadi is known as a fearless lady. She demanded justice whenever she saw any injustice act in front of her. When she was insulted, she asked for justice directly from the king of Hastinapur Dhritarashtra. She didn’t get back from her words and fight for justice in her entire life and believe in silence. She was popular for her fearless personality. 

She also asked for justice to the Sairandhri when Kichaka insulted her. She openly threatened the king Virata & Dhritrashtra & her husband’s because they failed to protect her. Along with that, she also condemned Bhisma, Kripacharya, and Drona for not saving her at the time of Chirharan. Because of this personality, Yajnaseni was her other name. `,
  },
  Dhritrastra: {
    Name: "Dhritrastra",
    Introduction: `Dhritarashtra (Sanskrit: धृतराष्ट्र, ISO-15919: Dhr̥tarāṣṭra) was a Kuru king, and the father of the Kauravas in the Hindu epic Mahabharata. He was the King of the Kuru Kingdom, with its capital at Hastinapura. He was born to Vichitravirya's first wife, Ambika.

Dhritarashtra was born blind.[1] He fathered one hundred sons and one daughter, Dushala, by his wife, Gandhari and a son, Yuyutsu, by his wife's maid. These children, including the eldest son Duryodhana, but not including Yuyutsu and Dushala, came to be known as the Kauravas.`,
    FairRole: `
    The blind king Dhṛtarāṣṭra is a typical personality – neither wholly good, nor wholly evil. His besetting sin is just that, for all his great physical strength, mentally he is weak and vacillating, oscillating continuously between good and evil. He has good impulses, but they are weak at the most. Throughout he knows, and feels, that injustice is being done to the Pāṇḍavas, of whom he himself is the family guardian. But he is ever prone to support and explain away the mischievous deeds and wickedness of his errant sons. As the sinister consequences of his own inaction loom large before him, he feebly tries to ease a guilty conscience by blaming it all on Destiny and the inscrutable dominance of daiva over pauruṣa.
    The exhibit #1 for bad parenting. He was blind to his children's faults & follies. He took no effort to correct them and way too biased towards his own children vs the duty he had. For such a bad parent, the just desserts was in seeing his dear ones go.`,
    UnfairRole: `
    Dhritarashtra’s physical disability compelled him to give up his dreams of becoming King despite being the rightful ruler. The bitterness fermented, leading to unwise and ill-advised decisions like the one not to return Indraprastha to the Pandavas — which some could argue led to the battle of Mahabharata.

    Vidura was one of the wisest and most straightforward advisors of King Dhritarashtra. But despite Vidura’s pleas and warnings, the King turned a blind eye (pun intended) to him, often with dire consequences.

    Dhritirashtra favoured his son Duryodhana, despite being aware of Duryodhana’s wrongdoings, as he was emotionally blind too. He did not think like a king, but like a father. He failed to control his son’s actions and arrogance, leading to an ill-advised war that had astronomical costs in terms of life.
    
    Leadership is about strength of character and the ability to take a decision and stand by it. Here lay the greatest failing of Dhritarashtra. His weakness is nowhere more apparent as when Draupadi was humiliated in his court but he chose to remain quiet, despite having the authority to stop a wrong from being committed.
